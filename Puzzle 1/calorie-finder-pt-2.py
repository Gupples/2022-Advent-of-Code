"""
Each elf in elves.csv is represented by a space between a set of calories. Find
the elf that has the largest calorie count and enter the total calories that
elf has. 
Strategy; Go through line by line. Run a total, and if the line is an empty
space, reset the count.

PART 2: find the 3 elves carrying the most and add their totals together.
STRATEGY; Sort my list of elves after getting it (from greatest to smallest)
and add the first 3 indexes together.
